              <h2>Question : what is cors??</h2>
              <h6>
                Answer : Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header
                based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins
                (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a
                browser should permit loading resources.

              <h2>Question : How does the private route work??</h2>
              <h6>
                Answer : The private route component is similar to the public
                route, the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate
                condition. If the user is not authenticated he will be
                redirected to the login page and the user can only access the
                authenticated routes If he is authenticated (Logged in).

              <h2>Question : What is Node? How does Node work? ??</h2>
              <h6>
                Answer : Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that
                achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a
                “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words,
                Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests
                to return.
